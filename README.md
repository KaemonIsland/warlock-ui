# warlock-config

A collection of UI components created by Kaemon Lovendahl

Check out all the components on storybook at https://kaemonisland.github.io/warlock-ui

## Motivation

I'm slowly getting into design and as a way to practice I'm creating this collection of UI components. It also helps my work stay consistent across my various projects.

## Getting Started

Simply add warlock-ui with `yarn add warlock-ui`. This will make every UI component available for import.

Importing a component is as easy as `import { FlipCard } from 'warlock-ui'`


## Notes on Front End Dev philosophies/ideas

### Random Events

For apps that rely on user-interaction there should be very very very small chances that a random event occurs! Maybe a message, or a color change, maybe a button clicks a little different?

This interactions should have users asking each other "Did you guys see that?" This will drive further user-interaction and interest within an application.

### Gamification

Achievements should also be included in order to present achievements within high user-interaction websites. This way users can select goals, or compare "Scores" with each other. Something like Reddit Karma, or Video Game achievements.

Maybe they can award profile border variations, theme changes, or maybe different fonts? Something that can make a user stand out or feel like a more personal experience.
