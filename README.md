# warlock-config

A collection of UI components created by Kaemon Lovendahl

## Motivation

I'm slowly getting into design and as a way to practice I'm creating this collection of UI components. It also helps my work stay consistent across my various projects.

## Getting Started

Simply add warlock-ui with `yarn add warlock-ui`. This will make every UI component available for import.

Importing a component is as easy as `import { FlipCard } from 'warlock-ui'`
